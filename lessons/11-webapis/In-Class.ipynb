    "Key takeaways from this demonstration -\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many API's out there \n",
    "- Countless ways to call an API\n",
    "- All use HTTP which means they will pass data via query string header, URL, and request body.\n",
    "- Most require some form of authentication\n",
    "- Most return JSON, some return XML. JSON is easier to de-serialize in Python\n",
    "- You must read the documentation to figure out how to use them!\n",
    "- Stick to using the HTTP prococol - avoid their sample code in Python or some other language.\n",
